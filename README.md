# Arms Smuggling GEOINT + OSINT Case Study

This project is an open-source case study demonstrating how **Geospatial Intelligence (GEOINT)** and **Open Source Intelligence (OSINT)** can be used together to identify and analyze suspected arms smuggling routes using publicly available data and satellite imagery.

## Objective

To simulate the tracking of illicit weapons shipments across a specific region (e.g., Middle East, Africa, or Eastern Europe) using:
- Open-source satellite imagery
- Geospatial analysis tools (QGIS, SentinelHub, Python)
- OSINT techniques (social media, maritime trackers, NGO reports)

## Tools & Technologies

| Tool | Use |
|------|-----|
| QGIS / ArcGIS | Satellite image analysis |
| SentinelHub | Free/open satellite imagery |
| Python (GeoPandas, Rasterio, Matplotlib) | Programmatic image/data analysis |
| Google Earth | Historical satellite comparison |
| AIS/Vessel Trackers | Ship tracking |
| Social media scraping | Cross-validation of ground activity |

## Methodology

1. **Region Selection:** Choose a geopolitical hotspot or known smuggling corridor (e.g., Horn of Africa, Libya, Ukraine).
2. **Imagery Collection:** Use SentinelHub, Landsat, or Google Earth to find high-resolution satellite images.
3. **Geospatial Analysis:** Identify patterns of interest (e.g., unmarked ships, construction of depots, remote runways).
4. **OSINT Correlation:** Gather open-source data such as:
   - NGO/UN reports
   - Social media geotags
   - AIS ship tracker logs
5. **Reporting:** Combine findings into a structured intelligence report using GEOINT tradecraft.
